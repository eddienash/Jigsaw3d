<h2 style=text-align:center>Jigsaw3D Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Our lawyers had us include the long legal document that follows, but first we want to tell you in plain English how we handle your privacy:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We encourage questions and feedback via email. If you send us an email, you will likely include your return email - especially if you'd like a response.</p></li>
<li><p>That is the <b>only</b> way we use your email address - to reply to you.</p></li>
<li><p>We won't share your email address, we won't sell it. We hate SPAM as much as anyone</p></li>
<li><p>We don't collect or save or use anything else. No user IDs, no phone numbers - nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>We do have ads (we need to pay the bills). We don't control the people who advertise - but they have their own Privacy Policies.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So go ahead and read the rest. Then just relax and enjoy doing the puzzles. That's all we really want!</p>
