	<p>What makes Jigsaw3D challenging is moving around in 3D space.</p>

	<p>
		To get started, we suggest you <span class=tip>read this first</span>,
		then try the Cube puzzle with the "Really Easy" level of difficulty.
	</p>

	<h2>Looking Around in 3D</h2>

	<p>Drag the background to view the puzzle from different angles and
		positions:</p>

	<p>
		<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/btn_rotate_icon.png"
			height=32px width=32px> In rotate mode dragging will rotate the
		puzzle to let you see different sides.
	</p>

	<p>
		<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/btn_pan_icon.png" height=32px
			width=32px> In pan mode dragging will move the puzzle around.
	</p>

	<p>
		<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/btn_zoom_out_icon.png"
			height=32px width=32px> <img
			src="file:///android_res/drawable/btn_zoom_in_icon.png" height=32px
			width=32px> You can zoom in and out with the zoom controls.
	<p>
	<p>
		<span class=tip>Tip:</span> Double tapping the background will center
		the puzzle and zoom it so all the pieces are in view.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class=tip>Tip:</span> A long press will let you see what the
		puzzle looks like all put together.
	</p>

	<h2>Moving the pieces</h2>

	<p>Move the puzzle pieces by dragging them with your finger. When
		you drag a piece, its bounding box will "light up" with red and green
		lines.</p>

	<p>
		<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/bounding_box.png"
			class=centered_image height=64px width=64px>
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class=tip>What's a bounding box? </span>A bounding box is a
		virtual box that surrounds each piece. It's the smallest rectangular
		box that will hold the piece.
	</p>

	<p>When you drag a piece, the green lines surround the face you are
		touching. You can only drag the piece parallel to that face. For
		example, if you are touching the front face, you can only drag the
		piece up, down, left or right, not back and front. If you are touching
		the top face, you can only drag forward, backward, left and right, but
		not up and down.</p>

	<p>Sometimes when a piece seems stuck, it's because the bounding
		box of another piece is in the way. You'll have to move that piece
		first.</p>

	<p>When the piece is close to where it belongs in the puzzle, it
		will snap into place.</p>

	<h2>Hint Boxes</h2>

	<p>
		<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/hints.png" class=centered_image
			height=64px width=64px>
	</p>

	<p>Those grey boxes in the center are the puzzle positions for the
		pieces, to help guide you. For more of a challenge, you can change the
		Hints to dots in the preference settings.</p>

	<p>Good luck and enjoy!</p>
